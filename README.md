## Introduction

SelfyAI combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to create dynamic virtual agents. These agents can perform tasks, provide information, and interact with users in a meaningful way. By tokenizing these agents, we enhance their usability and security, making them accessible to a broader audience.

## Features

- **Tokenization**: Each virtual agent can be represented as a unique token on the blockchain.
- **Interactivity**: Users can engage with agents through a simple interface.
- **Security**: Leveraging blockchain technology ensures data integrity and security.
- **Scalability**: The system can support multiple agents simultaneously, making it adaptable to various needs.
- **Community-Driven**: Contributions from developers and users shape the evolution of the project.
